The key to making super crispy honey chilli potatoes is to batter fry the potato fingers twice. Deep frying them only once results in potatoes that donâ€™t hold their shape and get soggy after a few minutes. So the potatoes are first coated in a dry mixture, deep fried till they are almost cooked and then cooled for a bit. They are then coated in a second coating of batter and deep fried again till they are really crisp outside and cooked perfectly inside. The last step is to coat them in a sesame honey chilli sauce that adds an extra layer of texture and is sweet and spicy.
